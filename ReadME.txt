Class Descriptions

Main.java
The entry point of the system. It presents the main menu where users can log in as a student, professor, or administrator, and interact with the respective functionalities.

Student.java
Represents a student user. Handles course registration, dropping courses, viewing schedules, grades, and managing complaints.

Professor.java
Represents a professor user. Professors can view the students enrolled in the courses they are teaching.

Admin.java
Represents the admin user responsible for managing the course catalog, assigning professors to courses, and handling student complaints.

Courses.java
Defines the structure of a course, including course code, title, prerequisites, enrolled students, and assigned professor.

Complaint.java
Handles the creation and tracking of student complaints, storing complaint descriptions, statuses, resolution details, and associated students.

Catalog.java
Maintains a list of courses available in the system. Handles adding, removing, and finding courses by their course codes.

Complaints.java (Interface)
Defines the contract for handling complaints with methods to get and set the description, status, and resolution details.

OOP Concepts Used
1. Encapsulation:
Each class encapsulates its own data and exposes necessary functionalities through public methods. For example, the Student class holds information about registered courses and complaints, providing methods to modify these attributes.

2. Inheritance:
The Student, Professor, and Admin classes inherit from a common User class, reusing common attributes such as name, ID, and email.

3. Polymorphism:
Polymorphism is used in handling complaints, where different types of complaints can be managed uniformly through the Complaints interface.

4. Abstraction:
The Complaints interface abstracts the common functionalities of complaints, making the system flexible for handling different types of complaints.
